Shooter's mother was making straw purchases of guns for him, encouraging his gun obsession. Shooter shot his mother before he went to the school and finally he shot himself. Shooter was carrying his brother's ID and police initially thought he was the shooter. Police found a safe with over 1400 rounds of ammo in his home, multiple weapons, NRA certificate, and a photograph holding a gun to his head. Shooter had cut off contact with both his father and brother in the two years before the shooting and at one point communicated with his mother, who lived in the same house, only by email. He had his windows covered with black garbage bags. He was mostly living in isolation and played computer games. He was home-schooled since 8th grade. He was examined by several psychiatrist, took medication for a short time but was not open to therapy. He started editing Wikipedia entries on various well-known mass murderers.\")\n",
